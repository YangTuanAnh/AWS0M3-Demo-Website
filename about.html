    	Our team has proposed a simulation-based web app that utilizes role-playing elements to educate others about the ins and outs of different types of jobs. The simulations presented are choice-based scenarios created by referencing through various forms of media or surveying people within the industries. Subsequently, the choices made within the simulations would reflect how well suited you are for that type of job and provide related material for users to further look upon the topics if interested.
